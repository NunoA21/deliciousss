# Deliciousss mini project

This project is for training purposes and it follows this video here [DevEd Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc4uOzlndAk&ab_channel=DevEd).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm packages installed`

Here we'll have some packages installed that are going to be useful for this mini project:

1. **framer-motion:**

   This package is for some animations: `npm install framer-motion`.

   In our project, we ran this command: `npm install framer-motion react-icons react-router-dom styled-components`

   This will instal some things for react routing, icons and some styled components that we will use in the project.

2. **react-splide:**

   It's for the carousel animation.
   This is the command we'll use: `npm install @splidejs/react-splide` (the command in the video didn't worked, so we had to use this one for it to work).
